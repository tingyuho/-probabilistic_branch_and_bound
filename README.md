## Probabilistic Branch and Bound for Level Set Approximation ##

This solver is based on the simulation optimization algorithm called probabilistic branch and bound with confidence intervals (PBnB with CI):

>PBnB approximates a target set of solutions for stochastic
global optimization problems. A set of solutions allows decision makers to have further
understanding of their problem. The algorithms are capable to solve problems with mixed
continuous and discrete variables.[Adaptive probabilistic branch and bound with confidence intervals for level set approximation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6721488)
